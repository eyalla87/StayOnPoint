# StayÂ OnÂ Point â€“ Speakingâ€‘Focus TrainerÂ ðŸ“±

## Purpose

**StayÂ OnÂ Point** is a pocket coach that helps anyoneâ€”especially people with ADHDâ€”practice delivering clear, concise messages.  It guides you to articulate a single idea using the **PPP structure**:

1. **Point**Â â€“ the core message.
2. **Proof**Â â€“ one supporting example or fact.
3. **Purpose**Â â€“ why it matters or what you need.

The goal is to build "muscle memory" for organised thinking, so you can hold an audienceâ€™s attention in everyday conversations, meetings, or presentations.
